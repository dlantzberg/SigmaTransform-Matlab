# SigmaTransform-Matlab
Implements the Sigma Transform, as defined in the thesis _"Quantum Frames and Uncertainty Principles arising from Symplectomorphisms"_, in MATLAB.

The code, written and tested on _MATLAB R2016a_, with the Signal Processing toolbox installed, should be self-contained and, thus, cloning the repository or copying _all_ the files, found in this repository, to a local folder and changing the Matlab-path to this folder should be enough to use and test the code provided.
The two examples

    Examples_SigmaTransform1D.m
    Examples_SigmaTransform2D.m

show how to use the implementation.

The code should also run on GNU Octave, tested with _GNU Octave 4.4.1_, with the _signal and image packages_ installed and _loaded_.
