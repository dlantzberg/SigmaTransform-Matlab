# SigmaTransform-Matlab
Implements the Sigma Transform in MATLAB.

The code, written and tested on _MATLAB R2016a_, should be self-contained and, thus, copying _all_ the files, found in this repository, to a local folder and changing the Matlab-path to this folder should be enough to use and test the code provided.
The two examples 

    *Examples_SigmaTransform1D.m*  and 
    *Examples_SigmaTransform2D.m* 
    
show how to use the implementation.
